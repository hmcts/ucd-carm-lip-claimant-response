      Telephone mediation
    </h1>

    <p>You have rejected the claimant’s offer of £50. The next step is telephone mediation to see if an agreement can be reached before going to court.</p>

    <p>An impartial mediator will speak with both parties independently. You will be able to explain your reasons for rejecting the offer in more detail.</p>

    <p>You can either attend mediation yourself, or you can nominate someone else within the business to attend on your behalf.</p>

    <p>Mediation will last no longer than one hour and will take place by telephone.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What happens at mediation?
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">We will arrange a phone call with a mediator from the Small Claims Mediation Service. The
      mediator will:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>listen to each side separately – you will not talk directly to the other side</li>
      <li>ask you to consider what the other side says</li>
      <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What happens if you do not attend your mediation appointment?
    </h2>
    <p>If nobody attends the mediation appointment to represent your company, the judge may apply a penalty. This could include the judge ordering you to pay costs, or automatically ruling in the other party’s favour.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      After the phone call
    </h2>

    <p>If mediation is successful, you will not have to go to court. An agreement will be made over the phone, which we will email to you. You will not have to sign anything, but the agreement is binding..</p>
    <p>If either party breaks the terms of the agreement, the other party can go back to the court to ask for a judgment or hearing.</p>
    <p>If an agreement is not reached at mediation, you may need to attend a court hearing. Any mediation discussions cannot be mentioned at the hearing.</p>
